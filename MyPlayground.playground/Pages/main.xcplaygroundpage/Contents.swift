/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here

func helloWorld() {
    print("Hello World")
}

helloWorld()

/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here

func helloWorld2() {
    let text = "Hello World2"
    print(text)
}

helloWorld2()


/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

func helloPerson(name : String){
    print("Hello \(name), How is your day going?")
}

helloPerson(name: "Bob")
helloPerson(name: "Nick")
helloPerson(name: "Melissa")
helloPerson(name: "Amy")

/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

var name = "Steve"

helloPerson(name: name)

"As long as you declare the var as a string it will pass."


/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
// write your code here


func myOwnFunction(){
    var testVar = 33
    print(testVar)
    testVar = 53
    print(testVar)
}
myOwnFunction()

"As long at the varible is of the same type you can you can keep assinging it what you want if its not. Then it will error."
