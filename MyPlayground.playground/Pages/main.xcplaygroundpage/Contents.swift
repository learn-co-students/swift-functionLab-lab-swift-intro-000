 */
/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here

func helloWorld() {
    
    print("Hello, world!")
}

helloWorld()


/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here

func declareConstant() {
    
    let someConstant = "some random text"
    print(someConstant)
}

declareConstant()


/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

func printName(name:String) {
    
    print("Hello \(name)!")
}

printName(name: "John")
printName(name: "Marc")
printName(name: "Sally")


/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

var name1 = "Billy"
printName(name: name1)
name1 = "Jonathan"
printName(name: name1)


/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
// write your code here

func fakeAge() {
    
    var age = 25
    print(age)
    age = 31
    print(age)
    
}

fakeAge()
fakeAge()
