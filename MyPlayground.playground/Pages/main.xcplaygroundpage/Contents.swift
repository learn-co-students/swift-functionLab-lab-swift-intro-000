/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here

func helloWorld() {
print("Hello world!")
}
helloWorld()


/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
// write your code here

func work(timeOfWork: Int) {
let String = "Work"
print("My \(String) starts at \(timeOfWork) am.")
}
work(timeOfWork: 8)

/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

func person(name: String) {
print("Hi \(name) how are you!")
}


person(name: "Jim Campagno")
person(name: "John Tayler")
person(name: "Ben Ben")


/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */

// write your code here

var bestName = "Volha"
person(name: bestName)
bestName = "Yulia"
person(name: bestName)


/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
// write your code here

func myFunction() {
var greeting = "pizza"

    print("I like \(greeting)")
    greeting = "burger"
    print("I like \(greeting)")
    
}
myFunction()
