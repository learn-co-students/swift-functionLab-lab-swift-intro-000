/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func helloWorld(){
	print("Hello, World!")
}

helloWorld()




/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func constantPrint(){
	let myConstant = "Live Long and Prosper!"
	print(myConstant)
}

constantPrint()


/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
func helloThere(name: String){
	print("Hi there \(name)!")
}

helloThere(name: "Dean")
helloThere(name: "Dea")
helloThere(name: "donna")


/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
var currentName = "Bob"
helloThere(name: currentName)
currentName = "Jeorgina"
helloThere(name: currentName)




/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */
func varFun(){
	var x = 123
	print(x)
	x = 456
	print(x)
}
