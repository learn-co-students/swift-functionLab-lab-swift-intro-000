/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func helloWorld() {
    print("Hello, world!")
}// write your code here

helloWorld()




/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func goodbyePerson() {
    let name = "Anthony"
    print("Have a good day \(name)!")
}
goodbyePerson()

// write your code here




/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
func helloName(name: String) {
    print("Hello \(name)")

} // write your code here

helloName("Chris")
helloName("Justin")
helloName("Kyle")



/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
let nameOne = "Tyler"
helloName(nameOne)

var nameTwo = "John"
helloName(nameTwo)


// write your code here




/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?
 */

func helloVar() {
    var greeting = "Hey"
    print("\(greeting), what's up?")
    greeting = "Yo"
    print("\(greeting), what's up?")
}

helloVar()
helloVar()


// write your code here
