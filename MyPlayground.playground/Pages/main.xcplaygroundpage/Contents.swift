/*: question1
 ### 1. Write a function called `helloWorld()` that prints "Hello, world!" to the console. Then call it to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */
func helloWorld(){
    print("Hello, world")
}

helloWorld()








/*: question2
 ### 2. Write your own function in which you declare a constant inside the function's body and then print that constant to the console. Call this function to see your string printed to the playground console.
 */


func kpFunction(){
    let iOSlang = "SWIFT"
    print(" \(iOSlang) is the latest programming language used for iOS Development")
    
    }

kpFunction()



/*: question3
 ### 3. Write a function that takes a person's name as an argument and prints a greeting to the console. Call it several times with different arguments. What do you think you'll see in the console?
 */
func diffArgs(thisPerson:String){
 print("hello \(thisPerson), it is good to see you today...")
    
}

func diffArgsReply(thatPerson:String){
    print("It is good to see you as well \(thatPerson)")
}

diffArgs(thisPerson: "kris")
diffArgsReply(thatPerson: "Not kris")





/*: question4
 ### 4. Now call the function you wrote in Question 3 using a variable or constant instead of a string literal. What do you expect to see in the console? Try passing in a _variable_ you declared (using `var`) as an argument. Then change that variable's value and call your function again. What do you see in the console?
 */
var notMyName = "Alex"
let maybeMyNameIs = "Barbara Ann"

diffArgs(thisPerson: maybeMyNameIs)
diffArgsReply(thatPerson: notMyName)



/*: question5
 ### 5. Write your own function in which you declare a _variable_ (of any type) inside the function's body. Print out this variable to the console from within your function. After you print the variable once, assign a new value to this variable on the next line. Print it again (after the line on which you assign it to a new value). Call your function several times. What do you expect to see printed to the playground's console each time you call this function?

var myString = "krishna"

func multiPrintOut(){
    var thisNumber = 45
    
    print(thisNumber)
    thisNumber = 54
    print(thisNumber)
    
    
}


multiPrintOut()
